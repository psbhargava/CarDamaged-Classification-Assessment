# CarDamaged-Classification-Assessment

Assessing Car Damage with Convolutional Neural Networks

A proof of concept to use computer vision and deep learning to check whether a car is damaged or not and if damaged check severity and location. Trained a pipeline of convolutional neural networks using transfer learning on DenseNet-201 with Keras and Tensorflow to classify damage.
